# Obsidian Frondescence

A theme for Obsidian users to publish their notes, with the [Digital Garden Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden). 

The default theme supplied by the plugin has a variety of minor problems:

- Weird HTML, like buttons that are `span`s. This is bad for accessibility.
- Mish-mashed styles
- Entire sections of unused Obsidian code
- Over-reliance on client side JavaScript, when this should be static content

See the README in the plugin repo for information on how to set it up.
